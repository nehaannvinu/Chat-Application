Simply Chat is a Realtime Chat Application created using React with the help of Social Auth and dedicated chat APIs/sockets.

The chat application allows the user to login using their Google account with Social Authentication acheived using Firebase.

This chat application uses Chat Engine API, a great tool that provides a fully functioning messaging environment where users can find other users and chat with them by creating rooms. Works great just like any other chatting app like Messenger or Teams!
